## Running RancherOS on Amazon Web Services

### Launching RancherOS through the AWS console

RancherOS is available as an Amazon Web Services AMI, and can be easily run on EC2.  Letâ€™s walk through how to import and create a RancherOS on EC2 machine using the AWS console.


1. First login to your AWS console, and go to the EC2 dashboard, click on **Launch Instance**:

2. Select the **Community AMIs** on the sidebar and search for **RancherOS**. Pick the latest version and click **Select**.

3. Go through the steps of creating the instance type through the AWS console. Choose your instance type, configure instance, add storage, tag instance, configure security group, and review. After you click on **Launch**, either create a new key pair or choose an existing key pair to be used with the EC2 instance. If you have created a new key pair, download the key pair. If you have chosen an existing key pair, make sure you have the key pair accessible. Click on **Launch Instances**.

4. Your instance will be launching and you can click on **View Instances** to see it's status.

    Your instance is now running!

5. After your instance is up and running, let's get into the RancherOS terminal so we can start using it. From your EC2 Dashboard, click on your new instance. Click on **Connect**.

6. Select **A Java SSH Client directly from my browser (Java required)**." Fill in the Private key path where the shown key name is saved. Click on **Launch SSH Client**.

7. For Mac users, the first time launching the SSH client will require you to accept the MindTerm license agreement. This is required by Amazon in order to launch the Java applet. Click **Accept**.

    Click **Yes** to create the MindTerm home directory.

8. A browser should launch that allows you to access the RancherOS command line.

### Launching RancherOS through the AWS Command Line Interface

If you prefer to use the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/), let's walk through that process:

1. If you haven't installed the AWS CLI, follow the instructions on the [AWS CLI page](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to install. If you've already installed and configured AWS, just skip step 2. 

2. After you have installed AWS CLI, you'll need to configure your AWS. 

    ```bash
    $ aws configure
    ```
    
    Input your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key and Region name. You do not need to put in a output format name and can just leave it blank. 
    
    Note: Access Key ID and Secret Access Key can be found in the **Security Credentials** section of AWS. If you don't have one, **Create New Access Key**. When created, make sure to save the Secret Access Key. Or you can follow the instructions on AWS on how to create an IAM User account. 

    ```bash
    $ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: ABCD 
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ABCD 
    Default region name [None]: us-east-1
    Default output format [None]:
    $
    ```
 
3. Once you've configured your AWS, use this command to launch an EC2 instance with the RancherOS AMI. You will need to know your SSH key name and security group name for the _region_ that you are configured for. These can be found from the AWS console.

    Note: See **Latest AMI Releases** for AMI names. 

    ```bash
    $ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-ID# --count 1 --instance-type t1.micro --key-name MySSHKeyName --security-groups sg-name
    ```

4. After the image has been created, you can go to the EC2 dashboard to check that the instance is running. You can either connect into the instance from the AWS console or continue using command lines. If you follow the AWS console command, you must make sure to log in as the rancher user instead of the root user. 


    ```bash
    $ ssh -i /Directory/of/MySSHKeyName.pem rancher@<ip-of-ec2-instance>
    [rancher@rancher ~]$
    ```

    If you have issues logging into RancherOS, try using this command to help debug the issue.

    ```bash
    $ ssh -v -i /Directory/of/MySSHKeyName.pem rancher@<ip-of-ec2-instance>
    ```

After you're logged into the system, go back to the [Getting Started Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started/) to see some examples of what we can do.
